### **24. 10X pilots:** Federate autonomy to partners to frontrun long-pole risks at the next zero.

#### **Dive deeper:** Federating autonomy - Autonomy is a trade-off between control (high-cost) and efficiency (low cost). Federation considers the degree of autonomy using the appropriate RACI model, control level (outcomes,interactions & safety) depending on the Cynefin state (disorder, chaos, simple) of channel groups. *Focus on maturity* with chaotic groups which requires stronger centralized accountability & controls (processes & tools) that define consistent I/O for outcomes, interactions & safety. *Transition to efficiency* as groups become ordered. Stay informed but delegate control to representative sub-groups and try to minimize centralized accountability to safety.
