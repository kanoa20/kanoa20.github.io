# What is my leadership philosophy?

### As a leader, I have focused on 3 things:
* Setting the strategic vision for new and existing businesses in IoT, SaaS and cloud markets
* Earning trust with global teams through transparent communication, cultural empathy, situational awareness and collective feedback
* Fostering partnerships and delivering results that delight customers, unblock critical path milestones, and drive business growth
