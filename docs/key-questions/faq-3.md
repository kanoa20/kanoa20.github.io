# What are some notable experiences?

### Amazon Web Services: IoT Device Management
AWS is an infastructure-as-a-service provider; and I reside in the IoT business group. Our value proposition is to provide fully-managed, globally available compute and storage capabilities (cloud), while enabling customers to reduce their IT costs to manage devices. I owned the Device Management service and created a 2-year growth plan which initially addressed "table stakes" themes that unblocked lighthouse customers from adopting the service. In addition to repricing one of our product lines and creating an incentive program for our largest customers to trial our service, I worked with several cross-functional teams to launch Secure Tunneling and positioned it as a higher-value product targeted at the enterprise market segment.

### KEYPR: IoT & Cloud services and partnerships for smart hotels
KEYPR is an IoT company that provides a consolidated, fully-managed suite of cloud, mobile and web applications for hotel and building operators to manage their day-to-day operations. Our value proposition was to improve guest experience while also reducing customer operating costs. I owned the cloud service and created an 18-month plan to scale our business. We refactored our microservices architecture on AWS and launched key features such as skip-the-front-desk checkin experience, automated checkout and housekeeping management to meet lighthouse customer needs and mind the gap with market leaders in service request optimization such as HotSOS. I also created a partnership strategy to prioritize integration partners with property management vendors (e.g. Infor), in-room automation services (e.g. Inncom), and keyless locking companies (e.g. Assa Abloy) to shorten our critical path for onboarding customers and leverage our collective inertia to scale faster with both luxury and boutique hotels.

### OTOY: VR ecosystem
OTOY is a virtual reality, lightfield and GPU-based rendering company. Our value proposition was to provide VFX studios the ability to render the highest visual scene quality in the shortest amount of time. I led a global technical team to stitch together and launch our VR ecosystem including mobile VR app, cloud rendering service, and native rendering application to provide end-to-end content creation to consumption. I also led our marketing, content and integration partnerships with Fortune 500 technology companies, major studios, and professional sports agencies that significantly increased activation and adoption of our product lines.

### PitchBook: Public data platform
PitchBook is a market intelligence company focused on private and public market transactions. Our value proposition was to provide a consolidated interface to access high-quality market data in a timely manner with minimal need to code. I owned the public data roadmap and created a 3-yr strategy doc and several proposals for datasets and features that we needed in order to position ourselves as a viable alternative to market leaders e.g. S&P CapIQ, Factset for the investment banking segment. Specifically, I launched several enhancements including charting widget, valuation experience, broader financial data coverage & quality and calculation transparency (shown below). I also created training programs for the product and sales teams to understand different valuation methodologies used in M&As.

### MarketHeist: Digital marketing service
Soon after the stock market crash in 2008, Jeff and I bootstrapped MarketHeist to educate investors on basic investment concepts & strategies and recommend financial products based on their interests. We consulted hundreds of ex-Wall Street professionals to add their financial products to our catalog while improving their digital marketing & SEO; and partnered with several of them to create educational content on YouTube and our website. At our peak, we averaged several thousands of daily active users, while also increasing the adoption of financial products by up to 40%.
