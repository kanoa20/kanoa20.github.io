# What am I looking to improve?
In two words, influencing others. This means earning trust which requires speaking the right lexicon and anticipating others' concerns and questions. When I first graduated college, one of my colleagues and I were discussing about how math was the most ubiquitous skill to have in the workplace; and one of my directors just happened to walk by and chimed in "No. Communication, you'll see." And he was right. Communicating with individuals from different cultures, experiences and backgrounds has been a continuous learning process for me since becoming a product leader. But as I worked across several industries, I've been able to pick up new lexicons faster. This has helped me to navigate how best to convey messages that build trust with my audience, bring them along with my thought-process and influence them toward a specific outcome or decision. And while I've grown significantly in this aspect over the last several years, I belive that this is the most critical skill to have as a leader which means that I will continue to try to do better.
