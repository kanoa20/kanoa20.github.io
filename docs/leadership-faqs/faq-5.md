# What's my 10-year vision?

### Vision summary
My focus for the next 10 years will be to continue growing IoT, edge and machine learning businesses and services from early to mass market adoption to support highly distributed communities (remote economies). These technologies will be critical for progressing remote economy themes and use cases (e.g. remote work, education, health, and manufacturing) which I expect will decrease the high cost burden for basic necessities caused by global population growth patterns towards dense metropolitan areas over the past decades. These dense areas cause an increased concentration of demand for basic resources such as housing and healthcare that lower-income households increasingly cannot afford. My hypothesis is that by facilitating remote economies with technology (above), policy change incentivizing this demographic shift and infrastructure development prioritizing the regional mobility of resources, we can decrease this high resource cost burden which underpins some of our nation's biggest problems including our growing national debt and social inequality. I also expect positive externalities on environmental impact where we can reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint of global supply chains by producing a large proportion of non-durable goods regionally or locally.
