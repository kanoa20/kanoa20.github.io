# People. Vision. Results.

I am a growth-focused leader with a strong business acumen, an entrepreneurial mindset, a bias and pragmatism for driving results, and a deep understanding for building products that delight customers. With my diverse leadership background in product management, finance, and engineering in both corporate and start-up environments, I have extensive experience making data-influenced decisions and creating partnerships that exponentially grow businesses, and iteratively building IoT and cloud-based products that solve customer needs. I specialize in identifying new revenue opportunities, improving operational efficiencies, and mentoring, training and leading global multi-disciplinary teams to deliver measurable success across the product lifecycle.
